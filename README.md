# TO-DO-List-Application-in-C-
A TO DO List Application built in C++ | CRUD Operations 

This **To-Do List Application** is a simple C++ program designed to help users manage their daily tasks efficiently. It uses a `vector` of `Task` objects to store and organize tasks, allowing users to add, view, mark as completed, and delete tasks. The application is lightweight, runs in the terminal, and focuses solely on essential task management without file saving or loading. It requires a C++ compiler supporting C++11 or higher and is ideal for practicing basic C++ concepts or exploring small project ideas. Future enhancements could include task prioritization and a graphical user interface.
